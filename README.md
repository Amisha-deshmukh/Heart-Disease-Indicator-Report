# Heart-Disease-Indicator-Report
ü©∫  **Heart Disease Indicators Report (Power BI Dashboard):**

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of heart disease risk factors and health indicators. The report is designed to help visualize relationships between various health metrics and the likelihood of heart disease.

ü©∫ **Project Description:**

This Power BI dashboard project analyzes a dataset containing health-related attributes to identify indicators associated with heart disease. The report provides interactive visualizations to explore how factors like BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, mental health, and chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma, kidney disease) impact the likelihood of heart disease.

üõ† **Tools & Technologies:**

Power BI: for building the interactive dashboard

DAX: for creating calculated fields and measures

Data Cleaning: handled within Power BI using Power Query

üîç **Key Insights:**

Average BMI across all patients is 28.44, with an average sleep time of 7.08 hours.

Out of the total population, 27K are diagnosed with heart disease, and 33K are marked as high-risk.

The largest age group in the dataset is Older Age, followed by Middle Age and Young Age.

Physically active individuals tend to have a slightly lower BMI than those who are inactive.

People with poor general health and who smoke have a higher count of heart disease cases.

Mental health issues correlate with changes in both average BMI and sleep time.
